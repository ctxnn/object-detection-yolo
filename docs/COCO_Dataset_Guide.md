# COCO Dataset Guide

The COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset. This guide explains the structure of COCO and how it's used in the YOLO object detection project.

## Dataset Overview

COCO contains:
- 330K+ images
- 80 object categories
- 5 captions per image
- 1.5 million object instances
- 250,000+ people with keypoints

For our object detection project, we focus on the detection task, which involves identifying objects in images and drawing bounding boxes around them.

## Dataset Structure

The COCO dataset is organized as follows:

```
coco_dataset/
├── annotations/               # Annotation files
│   ├── instances_train2017.json  # Training annotations
│   ├── instances_val2017.json    # Validation annotations
│   └── ...
├── train2017/                 # Training images (~118K images)
├── val2017/                   # Validation images (~5K images)
└── test2017/                  # Test images (~41K images, no annotations)
```

## Annotation Format

COCO annotations are stored in JSON format. The structure of annotation files is as follows:

```json
{
  "info": {...},               # Dataset info (version, contributor, etc.)
  "licenses": [...],           # License information
  "images": [                  # List of all images
    {
      "id": 242287,            # Unique image ID
      "width": 640,            # Image width
      "height": 480,           # Image height
      "file_name": "000000242287.jpg",  # Image filename
      "license": 1,            # License ID
      "flickr_url": "...",     # Original image URL (if applicable)
      "coco_url": "...",       # COCO image URL
      "date_captured": "..."   # Date captured
    },
    ...
  ],
  "annotations": [             # List of all annotations
    {
      "id": 125686,            # Unique annotation ID
      "image_id": 242287,      # ID of the image this annotation belongs to
      "category_id": 1,        # Category/class ID
      "segmentation": [[...]],  # Polygon coordinates for segmentation
      "area": 42307.67689,     # Area of segmentation
      "bbox": [4.56, 13.89, 398.33, 305.92],  # [x, y, width, height]
      "iscrowd": 0             # Whether the object is a crowd (0=no, 1=yes)
    },
    ...
  ],
  "categories": [              # List of categories/classes
    {
      "id": 1,                 # Category ID
      "name": "person",        # Category name
      "supercategory": "person"  # Broader category it belongs to
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## COCO Object Categories

COCO includes 80 object categories, organized into 12 super-categories:

1. **Person**: person
2. **Vehicle**: bicycle, car, motorcycle, airplane, bus, train, truck, boat
3. **Outdoor**: traffic light, fire hydrant, stop sign, parking meter, bench
4. **Animal**: bird, cat, dog, horse, sheep, cow, elephant, bear, zebra, giraffe
5. **Accessory**: backpack, umbrella, handbag, tie, suitcase
6. **Sports**: frisbee, skis, snowboard, sports ball, kite, baseball bat, baseball glove, skateboard, surfboard, tennis racket
7. **Kitchen**: bottle, wine glass, cup, fork, knife, spoon, bowl
8. **Food**: banana, apple, sandwich, orange, broccoli, carrot, hot dog, pizza, donut, cake
9. **Furniture**: chair, couch, potted plant, bed, dining table, toilet
10. **Electronic**: tv, laptop, mouse, remote, keyboard, cell phone
11. **Appliance**: microwave, oven, toaster, sink, refrigerator
12. **Indoor**: book, clock, vase, scissors, teddy bear, hair drier, toothbrush

## Converting COCO to YOLO Format

For training YOLO models, we need to convert the COCO annotation format to YOLO format. The YOLO format consists of one text file per image, with each line representing an object in the format:

```
class_id x_center y_center width height
```

Where:
- `class_id`: Integer ID of the object class (0-indexed)
- `x_center`, `y_center`: Normalized coordinates of the bounding box center (values between 0 and 1)
- `width`, `height`: Normalized width and height of the bounding box (values between 0 and 1)

Our project includes utilities to automatically convert from COCO to YOLO format.

## Using COCO in this Project

In this project, we:

1. Download the COCO dataset (or a subset of it)
2. Convert the annotations to YOLO format
3. Create a dataset configuration that YOLOv8 can use for training
4. Train the YOLOv8 model on COCO 
5. Evaluate the model's performance on COCO validation data

The conversion process is handled by the `utils/coco_dataset_utils.py` module, which provides functions to download the dataset, convert annotations, and visualize the data.
